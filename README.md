# Our Stopwords

* Auto-generated stopwords for South African Languages


## Introduction

* We present a list of auto-translated stopwords from English and adapt them to native [South African Bantu Languages](https://pubs.cs.uct.ac.za/id/eprint/1334/1/icadl_2019_banturecognition.pdf)

  
## Usage

- The data is provided in [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) format. Here is an example of using the stopwords in Python:

### Python Example

```python
import json

# Load the stop words from the JSON lines file
stop_words = []
with open('za_stopwords.main.jsonl', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    for line in file:
        stop_words.append(json.loads(line.strip()))

# Example: Print stop words in Zulu
for word in stop_words:
    print(f"English: {word['eng']}, Zulu: {word['zul']}")

```

> Refer to [`training_example.py`](./training_example.py) for a full working example on how you can use these stopwords in your model training scripts
