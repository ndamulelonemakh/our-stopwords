# Our Stopwords

* Auto-generated stopwords for South African Languages


## Introduction

* We present a list of auto-translated stopwords from English and adapt them to native [South African Bantu Languages](https://pubs.cs.uct.ac.za/id/eprint/1334/1/icadl_2019_banturecognition.pdf)


## Installation

You can install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install -U our-stopwords
```

## Quick Start

* The are two ways to use the installed version of `our-stopwords`


### 1. Using as a Python Library

```python
import our_stopwords

# List all available languages
available_languages = our_stopwords.list_available_languages()
print("Available languages:", available_languages)

# Get the list of stopwords for a specific language
stopwords = our_stopwords.get_stopwords('ven')
print(stopwords)
# Output: [{'eng': 'a', 'ven': 'a'}, {'eng': 'about', 'ven': 'nga'}, {'eng': 'after', 'ven': 'mulweli'}, ...]
```

### 2. Usage from the CLI

### List Available Languages

You can list all available languages supported by the package:

```bash
our_stopwords list
```

### Get Stop Words for a Language

To get stop words for a specific language, use the following command (replace `ven` with the language code of your choice):

```bash
our_stopwords get ven
```




  
## Manual Usage

- The data is provided in [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) format. Here is an example of using the stopwords in Python:

### Python Example

```python
import json

# Load the stop words from the JSON lines file
stop_words = []
with open('za_stopwords.main.jsonl', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    for line in file:
        stop_words.append(json.loads(line.strip()))

# Example: Print stop words in Zulu
for word in stop_words:
    print(f"English: {word['eng']}, Zulu: {word['zul']}")

```
